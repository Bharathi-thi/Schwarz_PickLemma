# Schwarz_PickLemma
For my project, I will be formalizing the statement and a proof of **Schwarz Pick Lemma**. 
```math
This states that let $f$ be a holomorphic self map defined on the open unit disk $\Delta$. Then for all $z_1, z_2 \in \Delta$, we have 

$$\frac{|f(z_1) - f(z_2)|}{|1 - \overline{f(z_1)} f(z_2)|} \leq \frac{|z_1 - z_2|}{|1 - \overline{z_1} z_2|}.$$
```

## My Goal/Plan
- First describe the automorphism group of the open unit disc.
- Proving the Schwarz Pick lemma using Schwarz Lemma. The schwarz lemma has already been formalized.  
- I will try to implement various applications of Schwarz Lemma.
